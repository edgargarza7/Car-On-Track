# Clone this Repo onto your AutoAuto Device

### Access your Jupyter Server

We'll heavily use Jupyter for this project. The first step now is to get access to the Jupyter server that is running on your device. To do that, go to your [device page](https://labs.autoauto.ai/autopair/) and click the yellow `i` button to see your device's "Info for Advanced Users". The modal that pops up will contain a link to your device's Jupyter server, and it will show you the password to access it (you can copy-paste that password).

### Obtain command-line access

After Jupyter opens in a new tab in your browser, and after you enter the password successfully, you now need to get command-line access to your device. In the top-right of the Jupyter tab, click the dropdown-menu that says "New", then click "Terminal". This opens another tab giving you command-line access to your device.

### Clone this repo

Now, enter the following command (copy-paste it) into that terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AutoAutoAI/Car-On-Track.git
```

That clones this repo onto your device! "Cloning" simply means you now have a copy of this repo (and all the stuff in this repo) on your local device.

### View the Repo in Jupyter

Now, go back to a previous tab in your browser that shows your Jupyter Home page. You should now see a folder there named "Car-On-Track". Click on that folder to navigate inside it. Now you should see all the files that are in this repo right there in your Jupyter session. This is wonderful, and you will now be ready for the next step! (Go back to the main instructions, and you can proceed to the next step.)
