    "\n",
    "_Machine Learning_ (ML) is a subfield of _Artificial Intelligence_. ML algorithms use training data to learn patters. **We** write the learning algorithm, then we feed training data into the algorithm so that it can \"learn\".\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is useful for:\n",
    "1. Having our computers detect patters which we humans **can't** detect, or\n",
    "2. Having our computers do tasks which are **boring** for us to do.\n",
